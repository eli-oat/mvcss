# MVCSS

Minimal Viable CSS (keeps HTML readable and speedy)

## How to use MVCSS

Simple as simple can be! Include the stylesheet in one of two ways...

With this handy CDN link:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://npmcdn.com/mvcss@3.0.1/mvcss.min.css" type="text/css" media="screen">
```

Or just paste the code into the head of your HTML document between `<style> ... </style>` tags. 

## Hold your horses... 🐴

What is this all about? 

MVCSS is a snippet of CSS that makes a bland HTML document a bit more readable and 100% responsive...as in, everything will fit on a device's screen. 

## Why is this an NPM package? 

Frankly, there isn't a great reason why. It isn't JS, and I almost never write JS, but I hadn't ever made an NPM package and I thought this would be a good, low-stress way to try it out. Using [NPMCDN](https://npmcdn.com) the package can be easily included on the fly, but, really, you oughtn't do that becuase this is so teeny-tiny you might as well include the whole kit-and-kaboodle in the head of your HTML and not bother with making an extra call.
